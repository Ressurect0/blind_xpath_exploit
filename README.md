# blind_xpath_exploit

A script that aids in retrieving XML output via Blind XPath Injection.
Features:
* Multi-processing
* Extract output starting from any node (from current node to child node only, recursion not yet added)
* Currently supports only POST form submissions
* Custom wordlist to reduce the possible bruteforce combinations

Note: Please modify the script to include cookies. This script was designed to retrieve sensitive XML data from a functionality where no authentication was required (Apparently the script performed faster without sending cookies.).
